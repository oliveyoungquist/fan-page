        There are many diffrent types of dogs. They range from small to extra large depending on the breed. Aside from size, dogs come in all colors. Some are solid colored such as labradors whereas some have spots such as dalmations. Diffrent breeds of dogs also have diffrent types of fur. Some are curly, some have shorthair, and some are flufffy. I love dogs becuase they are all unique and live for thier owners.
